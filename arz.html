Her mom had warned her. <br>She had been warned time and again, <br>but she had refused to believe her. <br>She had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion. <br>So when the promotion was given to her main rival, <br>it not only stung, it threw her belief system into disarray. <br>It was her first big lesson in life, <br>but not the last.
